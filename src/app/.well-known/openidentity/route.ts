 * GET /.well-known/openidentity

 * This is the canonical resolution endpoint for other agents and verifiers
 * that wish to inspect AxiomID's identity, controller, capabilities, and
 * linked wallet/passport references.
 *
 * The manifest is static (derived from the protocol's public identity, not a
 * per-user state) so it is safe to cache at the edge for an hour.
